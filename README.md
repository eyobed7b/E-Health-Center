# E-Health-Center
 
E-health center is a web-based application which provides online medical services
to everyone at their doorstep. This web- based application is more effective, quick 
in providing medical help especially to people in villages where very few doctors
are available. This helps the patients to maintain a neat health record and to lead a
healthy life. This system will help the users to identify certain diseases by answering
certain questions asked by the system. Based on the diagnose received from the
laboratory technician which is one part of the system  the user will be getting some
suggestion of medicines that are available at the local chemist without prescription
with an advice to visit the doctor. The system once ready should be able to train itself
with the feedback given to it (Artificial Intelligence).
